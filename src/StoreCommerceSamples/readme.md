# Store Commerce Samples
## Overview
This folder contains sample solutions that demonstrate how to customize the Store Commerce (and POS) App in various scenarios. Each sample contains a solution containing a Commerce Runtime project to enable the POS extension package and the POS extension package with the sample extensions. The samples are organized based on the type of customizations.

- Create: These extensions supplement POS by introducing new pages, dialogs or workflows that do not exist “out of the box”
- Extend: These extensions modify POS by adding additional functionality to existing pages, workflows or other functionality
- Solutions: These samples showcase a variety of extension types to enable a more complete feature or solution.
